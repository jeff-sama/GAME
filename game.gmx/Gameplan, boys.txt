Here is a general outline for the (as of yet unnamed) game:

	* = Things I'd like to see in the game, but not necessary (basically, we'll do it if we feel like it)

	-Game will be divided into "chapters", each of which will contain three stages, with the final stage containing a boss of some sort
		-Each chapter will have it's own unique locale and enemy types. (Ex. Research Laboratory, High Security Prison, Seaworld)
		-After each chapter will be a single stage connecting one locale to another.
		-The player will begin with only one party member (Fan), but as the game progresses will obtain the others
		-At this point I'm unsure how many chapters or stages we will do, will be decided as development progresses
		*-Secret Stages

	-Game will feature "run and gun" shoot-em-up gameplay.
		-Primary weapons will be guns, but players can obtain other types of weapons and items to be used.
		-Each party member can hold two weapons (or items) at once. The left and right mousebuttons are used to fire the two.
		-Party members can be switched by using the mousewheel. (If this is too weird number keys will be used instead)
		-All party members can be seen on screen following the "active" party member, which will be the one in control by the player.
		-Only the active party member will take damage from enemies. (Alternatively all party members will take damage, with the active player taking more)
		-When a party member dies, they will lay down where they died until revived.
		*-Each party member will have a unique ability accessed with the spacebar.
		-Status effects such as poison, blindness, etc.

	-Game will feature an inventory system
		-This can be accessed at the level select screen and via the pause menu.
		-Will allow the customization of players with different guns and items.
		-Items can be found laying on the ground in the levels, and will drop off of enemies
		*-Possibly will add a money system and a shop for items.
	
	-TYPES OF WEAPONS
		-Assault Rifles (fire multiple rounds in a line)
		-Shotuns	(fire multiple rounds in a spread)
		-Pistols/Sniper Rifles (fire single round)
		*-RPG		(fires single rocket, explosive radius)
		*-Beam or Laser gun (fires single beam, possibly bounces off of walls)
		*-Throwing weapon 	(grenade, shuriken, hadouken, etc)

	-TYPES OF ITEMS
		-Revive  (restore fallen party member to life with some health)
		-Bandage (restore health)
		-Antidote (cures poison or blindness)
		*-Bomb 	(it's a bomb, boom)
		-level-dependent items such as keys and things

	-Environments
		-Doors! (Open when stood near, cannot be shot through when closed)
		*-Destructable walls

	-Enemy AI
		-If player is spotted, enemies will attempt to move to a point near the player where they have a line of sight on the player to shoot
		-If enemy uses melee, will attempt to move up to player and hit them.
		-Bosses will have varied abilities.

	-Art Style!
		-Pixely (yeah, I know)
		-Surrealish future setting
		-Cyberpunk?
		-V A P O R W A V E
		- A E S T H E T I C

Brandon is currently working on pathfinding, good goy
Jeff is doing UI things and slacking off
Chris is on call for sprites
